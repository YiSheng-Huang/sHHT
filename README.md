# Stacked Hilbert-Huang transform (sHHT)
This repository contains major python codes to perform the simulation in the following paper: "Effectiveness of Stacks in the Stacked Spectrum Hilbert-Huang Transform" - Yen al. (2024).

In the aforementioned paper, we descirbe the different frequency dispersions generated from conventional HHT and sHHT. We also demonstrate the frequency dispersions derived from 3 signal examples, including a stable sinudoidal wave, a linear chirp signal and a logarithmic chirp signal. At final, we also perform the sHHT to examine the known GW events, similar to the application of sHHT in Hu et al. (2022) to study the 11 GW (gravitational wave) events recorded in O1-O2. In order to
